# AESOP-Lite Monte Carlo Simulation
### By Liam Branch & Robert Johnson
Simulating the propagation of scintillated photons in a circular plastic scintillator into a photomultiplier tube function to generate signal data. This signal data will then be used in a SPICE simulation program to observe any possible unwanted behavior.

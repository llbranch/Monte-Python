PARTICLE: Mean Free Path = 8e-05 cm
PARTICLE: Time Seperation between sequential Particles if simulation more than 1 = 100000.0
SCINT:    Probability of Scintillaton = 0.8
PMT:      Quantum Efficiency is set to 1 by default to keep more pulses
PMT:      Energy per Photoelectron is set to 20 by best estimation
PMT:      Artificial Gain on Output Current = 1
OUTPUT:   Binning Width for PWL output file = 100 ps

Run with .run() function given optional arguments below
integer n particles, 'delta_t' = 100000.0 ps particle time seperation
